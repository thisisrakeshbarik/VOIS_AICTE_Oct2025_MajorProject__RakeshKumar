📊 Netflix Data Analysis — VOIS AICTE Internship (Oct 2025)

This project was completed as part of the VOIS–AICTE Internship (October 2025) under Rakesh Kumar.
It focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset using Python and Pandas, uncovering insights into content types, genres, countries, ratings, and catalog growth over time.

🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to understand the trends in Netflix's catalog, including:

Growth in the number of titles over the years

Distribution of movies vs. TV shows

Popular genres and their evolution

Country-wise contributions to Netflix content

Duration trends (Movie runtime vs. TV show seasons)

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Steps performed:

Removed missing and duplicate entries.

Standardized column names and categorical values.

Parsed dates and extracted year_added.

Created derived columns for year-wise and type-wise analysis.

📈 Exploratory Analysis Highlights

Content Growth:
Visualized annual and cumulative growth of Netflix titles.

Genre Momentum:
Identified the most popular and emerging genres by year.

Country Analysis:
Compared content contribution across top-producing countries.

Content Type Trends:
Evaluated the ratio of Movies vs. TV Shows over time.

Duration Comparison:
